I am performing classifcation using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifers. I have run my implementations on
a binary class dataset. Following are the operations that I am performing:

Train and test a Logistic Regression Classifer to classify owers from the Iris Dataset.
Train and test a Logistic Regression Classifer to classify Spam or Not from the Spambase Dataset.
Train and test a Naive Bayes Classifer to classify Spam or Not from the Spambase Dataset.
Train and test a Decision Tree to classify Spam or Not from the Spambase Dataset.
